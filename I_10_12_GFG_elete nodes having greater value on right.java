Delete nodes having greater value on right
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 35.51%Submissions: 150K+Points: 2Average Time: 30m
Given a singly linked list, remove all nodes that have a node with a greater value anywhere to their right in the list. Return the head of the modified linked list.

Examples:

Input:
LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3
Output: 15->11->6->3

Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are the elements which have greater elements on the following nodes. So, after deleting them, the linked list would like be 15, 11, 6, 3.
Input:
LinkedList = 10->20->30->40->50->60
Output: 60

Explanation: All the nodes except the last node has a greater value node on its right, so all the nodes except the last node must be removed.
Constraints:
1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 106
1 ≤ element of linked list ≤ 106
