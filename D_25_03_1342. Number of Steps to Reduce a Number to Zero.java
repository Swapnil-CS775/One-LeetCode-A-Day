Hint
Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 2:

Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 3:

Input: num = 123
Output: 12
 

Constraints:

0 <= num <= 106

//Ans -->

class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        return helper(num,0);
    }

    public int helper(int n,int steps){
        if(n==0) return steps;

        if(n%2==0) return helper(n/2,steps+1);
        return helper(n-1,steps+1);
    }
}
